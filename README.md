## How It Works

The Weather App utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input. It uses vanilla JavaScript to make API requests and dynamically update the UI with the received weather information.

## Getting API Key

To run this app, you will need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). Sign up on their website and generate an API key. Then, replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the JavaScript file with your actual API key.

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
